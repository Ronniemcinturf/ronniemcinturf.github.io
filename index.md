### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 has a very special place in my heart because it was my first introduction to programming. I learned the basics of Git, Github, Unix,VS Code, and how to setup my work space. My partner and I programmed our first "Hello World" code! This lab sparked my interest in programming. 

* Lab 2

    Lab 2 taught me the basics of how to use strings and the cin and cout functions. I specifically liked this lab because of how the code prompted the user (in this case me) to input text into the terminal and then print it back out to me. This lab also taught me the industry standard formatting which is vital to collaborate with others. 

* Lab 10

    Lab 10 was incredibly useful to me by giving me a coding problem to practice using vectors. I came to understand in this lab how important vectors will continue to be throughout my coding journey. My partner and I did not finish this lab fully in the allotted time which pushed us to utilize Github to collaborate outside of class hours and complete the lab.
